# einstein-scalar-field
Basic numerical solver for the Einstein scalar field system in ADM slicing. The implementation is based on a [guide](https://fpretori.scholar.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf3006/files/documents/project_2.pdf) written by Frans Pretorius and Richard Price, and is intended as a learning project in the basics of numerical relativity.
